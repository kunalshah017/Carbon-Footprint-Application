My app will start with an instruction screen 

then it will ask user 10 environmental based question about how they are contributing to the environment 

answering each question will give user (1 mark or 0 mark or -1 mark) 
 so the total scroe will be 10 

 if a user scores above 7 then the user will silver footprint else user will get black footprint

to implement this user have to choose from three options (a,b,c) and this option choosed will decide their marks 

at last user will get to see there total marks obtained and after some loading the image will be shown
