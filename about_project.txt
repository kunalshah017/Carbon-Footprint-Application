Carbon Footprints 

I got this idea from a chapter in my 10 std textbook, named Footprints it is from a marathi textbook where a character makes such app 
we will try to recreate such app in c++ 
It is an easy project for beginerrs as I am also learning C++ 

project idea is to show one his or her carbon footprints 
the assets required are present in description 

the app will ask user some environmental based question where user have to answer honestly once answered all questions app will show users footprint

You can make you own app by this idea and feel free to use the assets given by me
